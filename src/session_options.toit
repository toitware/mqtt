  The $client_id (client identifier) will be used by the broker to identify a client.
    It should be unique per broker and can be between 1 and 23 characters long.
    Only characters and numbers are allowed

  If necessary, the $username/$password credentials can be used to authenticate.

  The $keep_alive informs the server of the maximum duration between two packets.
    The client automatically sends PINGREQ messages when necessary. If the value is
    lower, then the server detects disconnects faster, but the client needs to send
    more messages.
  If $keep_alive is set to 0, the broker does not disconnect due to inactivity, and
    the client won't send any ping requests.

  When provided, the $last_will configuration is used to send when the client
    disconnects ungracefully.
