  /**
  Constructs a new routing MQTT client.

  The $transport parameter is used to send messages and is usually a TCP socket instance.
    See $TcpTransport.

  The $routes must be a map from topic (of type $string) to callback. After the client started, it
    will automatically subscribe to all topics in the map (with a max-qos of 1). If the broker already
    has a session for this client (which can only happen if the $SessionOptions.clean_session flag
    is not set), then the client might receive messages for these topics before there was any time to
    call $subscribe, which is why it's a good idea to set the routes in the constructor.
