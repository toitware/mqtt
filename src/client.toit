/**
MQTT v3.1.1 Client with support for QoS 0 and 1.

All received messages are processed by a single call to $handle:

  client := mqtt.Client ...
  task::
    client.handle: | topic/string payload/ByteArray |
      print "Received message on topic '$topic': $payload"

Calls to $subscribe can be done at any time, with new messages arriving
  at the existing call to $handle.

If the client is closed, $handle will gracefully return. Any other ongoing
  calls will throw an exception.

  Constructs an MQTT client.

  The $client_id (client identifier) will be used by the broker to identify a client.
    It should be unique per broker and can be between 1 and 23 characters long.
    Only characters and numbers are allowed

  The $transport_ parameter is used to send messages and is usually a TCP socket instance.
    See $TcpTransport.

  If necessary, the $username/$password credentials can be used to authenticate.

  The $keep_alive informs the server of the maximum duration between two packets.
    The client automatically sends PINGREQ messages when necessary. If the value is
    lower, then the server detects disconnects faster, but the client needs to send
    more messages.

  When provided, the $last_will configuration is used to send when the client
    disconnects ungracefully.
